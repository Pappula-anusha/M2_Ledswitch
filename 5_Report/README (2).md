# Introduction:
Blinking of LED is a simple project in Embedded progamming world. There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. You can make one using relays. You can make one using transistors. Or you can make one using components like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller. Here swtich is used to blink the two LED using ATmega328(a microcontroller.
# Objective:
The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Components used:
1.ATmega328

2.Two LED

3.Switch

4.Resistor

# software used:
1.simulIDe

2.Visual Studie Code
# Research:
Atmega328 is an Atmel microcontroller, which is used in Arduino UNO board.Atmega328 has 28 pins in total. It has 3 Ports in total which are named as Port B,Port C and Port D.Port C is an analogue Port and it has six pins in total. So, in simple words, ATmega328 has 6 analogue pins.Port B and Port D are digital ports and have 7 pins each.So, in to Featuresal ATmega328 has 14 digital pins. It also supports Serial Communications, we can perform serial communication via Pin 2 (RX) and Pin 3 (TX).It also supports SPI Protocol.
# Features:
It has simple features.
1.It can switch off the LED's when switch is in off state.
2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
#  4W's and 1 H's

# Why:
1.To blink two LED's using a switch in ATmega328.
2.To understand basic concepts in ATmega328.
# When:
1.People are trying to learn an embedded programming language.
2.In schools and colleges it can be implemented.
# How:
1.By using softwares to exceute the program.
2.By loading the program in ATmega328.
# SWOT Analysis:

# Strengths:
1.Simple program to understand.
2.Cost effective.
# Weakness:
1.Basic program.
# Opportunities:
1.Program can be made more complex by adding more components.
# Threats:
1.There are advanced programs which are simple to learn is out already.
