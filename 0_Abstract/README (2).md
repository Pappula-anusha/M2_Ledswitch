# LED SWITCH 
In this project a simple LED ON/OF is done using ATmega 328 and a switch to controll the led turning off or on
LEDs are a simple, compact way to indicate the status of a circuit. By having the LED in the switch, it reduces space and component count for an assembly. There are many ways to control LEDs. Some indicator circuits use the switch's own circuity in an ON-OFF fashion.
